# IST-722-Data-Warhouse

## Project Mission
Understand FudgeFlix’s business metrics as online movie services have become a popular demand. With these metrics, we hope to see what features are or are not working for the company, see their strengths and weaknesses in hopes to develop a strategy in improving the business processes.

## Project Plan
First, we will data profile both Fudgemart and Fudgeflix, to get a better concept of what the data is telling us. For each table, what are the attributes and their relationships with each other. Then we can come up with various business processes that we want answered. We will be using Kimball’s Enterprise Bus Technical Architecture to design our database.

## Functional Requirements
The data must be able to track an order from the time it is placed to the time it is delivered. There must also be supplementary information which allows us to analyze any specific part of that process in detail.

## Overview of Business Process
From the functional requirements we will be able to model the business process of product ordering. There is extensive value in understanding this portion of the business as it includes data about how our sales and customer experience. We can analyze things like operational efficiency, stock keeping, and customer experience using this model.
